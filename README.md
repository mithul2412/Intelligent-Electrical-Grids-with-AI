# Intelligent Energy Management across Electrical Grids integrating Renewable Sources through AI, IoT, Blockchain

## Description
This project is my final-year Bachelor’s thesis focused on creating an intelligent smart grid management system, applicable from home-level microgrids to full-scale city grid infrastructures. By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain, the system optimizes energy distribution, solar forecasting, and grid stability. Multiple machine learning models—Stacking Classifier, ANN with Bayesian optimization, LSTM, and Deep reinforcement learning—are employed to ensure accurate predictions and efficient resource allocation. The platform is deployed using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalable performance, with dashboards powered by Looker Studio, and smart contracts managed via Kaleido blockchain.

## Key Features
- **Energy Distribution Optimization**  
  Forecasts and balances energy loads in real time, preventing power outages and overloads.
- **Solar Forecasting**  
  Uses deep learning (LSTM) for accurate short-term predictions of solar power output.
- **Grid Stability Analysis**  
  Employs stacked ensemble models and ANN with Bayesian optimization to predict and maintain stable grid operations.
- **Reinforcement Learning for Microgrids**  
  Dynamically manages battery charge–discharge cycles to maximize renewable energy usage and minimize grid dependence.
- **Blockchain-Based Verification**  
  Leverages Kaleido (optional) for secure and transparent energy transactions among prosumers.
